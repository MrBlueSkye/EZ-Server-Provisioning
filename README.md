this is the repo for Mark and Chas provisioning script

soon to install docker 


TODO:

Maybe seperate the scripts

Use a curses based menu system so you can pick and chose what you want 


need to add this curses frontend to the script and change up the if statments
to accept the arguments (0,1) from curses

Some way to change the user when installing the authenticator to the user that
was created during earlier part of the script
